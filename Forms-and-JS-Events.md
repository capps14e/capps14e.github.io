- How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

    *Events are just things that happen on a website, like a mouse trail, color change or a text box appearing when you put your mouse over a link.*



- When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?



  1. The event type that you want to listen for.
  2. The event listener function.



- Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

  *The event object in JavaScript is an object that contains information about an event that has occurred. It is passed to the event listener function as an argument. The target property of the event object is useful because it allows you to identify the element on which the event occurred. This can be useful for performing various actions, such as changing the appearance of the element, or getting its properties.*



- What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

  *Event bubbling and event capturing are two ways that events are propagated in the DOM tree. Event bubbling is the default behavior. Event capturing is the opposite of event bubbling.*

  *Event bubbling is the default behavior because it is more efficient. When an event bubbles up the DOM tree, it only needs to be processed by each element once.
Event capturing is less efficient, but it can be useful in some cases. For example, you could use event capturing to stop an event from bubbling up to the parent elements.*
