  *The figure element is used to group together a figure and its caption.*


### Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

  *An SVG will generally look much more crisp and sharp on larger screens than a GIF, they're just harder to make."

### What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
