<hr>

## What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

+ *code completion*
+ *syntax highlighting*
+ *a nice variety of themes*
+ *the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them*


## What do the following commands do? 

- **pwd** -    *prints the path of the working directory*
- **ls** -  *lists names of files and directories*
- **cd** -  *change current working directory*
- **mkdir** -  *allows user to create folders*
- **touch** -  *create or mopdify timestamps*

## Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

- **cd projects**
- **mkdir new-project**
- **touch new-project/newfile.md**
- **cd ..**
- **ls projects/new-project**

*User is creating a new folder, making timestamp and then verfies location of new folder.*
