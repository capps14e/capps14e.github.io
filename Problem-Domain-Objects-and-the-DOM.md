# Readings: Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

<hr>


- How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

  *An object is like a dog; a dog might have a property like breed or age. A dog may also have behaviors like playfulness or aggression.*

- What are some advantages to creating object literals?
    1. Readability
    2. Convenience
    3. Flexibility

- How do objects differ from arrays?

  *Arrays are used to store data in a sequential order, while objects are used to store data in a key-value format.*

- Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.

  *When the property name is a variable or the property name contains spaces or other special characters.*

    *This refers to the current object. The term this is dynamic and can change depending on context.*

- What is the DOM?

  *The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
The DOM represents a document as a tree of nodes. Each node represents an element, attribute, or piece of text in the document. The following diagram shows a simple DOM tree for an HTML document:*


- Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

  *The DOM and JavaScript are two closely related technologies that are used to build dynamic and interactive web pages. The DOM provides a programming interface for HTML and XML documents, while JavaScript is a programming language that can be used to manipulate the DOM.*
