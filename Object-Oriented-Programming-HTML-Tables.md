- Explain why we need domain modeling.

  *We need domain modeling because it helps us to ommunicate with others about the domain and design better software systems.*

- Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

   1. Tables do not respond well to different screen sizes.
   2. Tables can be slow to load, especially on mobile devices.
   3. Tables are meant to present tabular data, not to lay out a page.
   4. Search engines can have difficulty understanding the content of tables, which can hurt your SEO ranking.
   5. Tables are not very flexible when it comes to layout.

  
  
- List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML table.


  1. tbody Defines the table body rows.
  2. thead Defines the table header row.
  3. tfoot Defines the table header row.

- What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

   *A constructor is a special method that is called automatically when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's state.*

  1. Allows for different ways to initialize objects.
  2. Can be used to enforce invariants.
  3. Provides a single place to initialize objects.
  4. Ensures that objects are initialized correctly.

  
- How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

   *The keyword this refers to the current object. When used in an object literal, this refers to the global object, which is the window object in a browser environment. When used in a constructor, this   refers to the newly created object.*

- Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

  *I worked in manufacturing creating windows. Often we would create template windows or 'prototype' window for reference so that the windows that we manufactured could 'inherit' the properties of the reference 'prototype' window.*
