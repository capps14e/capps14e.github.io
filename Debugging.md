- Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

  *Syntax error is an error in the code that prevents the compiler from understanding it. A logic err is an error in the code that causes the program to produce incorrect output, even though it compiles and runs successfully.*



-List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.


     1. incorrect case: change to upper or lower case
     2. missing curly bracket: identify where error is occurring and add curly
     3. paramater name incorrect: enter correct name

- How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

    1. The JavaScript Debugger tool is a built-in feature of all modern web browsers.
    2. To use the JavaScript Debugger, you first need to open the developer tools in your browser. This can be done by pressing Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Opt+I (Mac).
    3. This can be very helpful for finding and fixing bugs in your code.
       



- Define what a breakpoint is.

    *A breakpoint is a marker in a program that tells the debugger to stop execution at that point. This allows the programmer to inspect the state of the program and identify any errors.*

    



- What is the call stack?


  *In debugging, the call stack is a list of all the functions that are currently being executed. It is used to track the flow of execution of a program and to identify the source of errors.*
