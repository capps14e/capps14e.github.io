- Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

  *I worked with a company that was severely lacking in psychological safety. One-on-one meetings were rare. It was very difficult to get any kind of feedback unless it was negative. Success was almost never celebrated; because of these shortcomings, the culture in the company was very depressing and productivity suffered.*

- What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

  *A high degree of psychological safety often lead to better results, better code and a higher level of morale; in short, a better team."
