1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

     - State management
     - Personalization
     - Offline support
     - Performance


   
2. What information should not be stored in local storage?

   - Sensitive user data
   - API keys
   - Authentication tokens
   - Sensitive user data
   - Any other information that you would not want to be publicly disclosed




3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

   *Local storage can only store strings. However, you can convert other data types to strings before storing them in local storage. You can use the toString() method to convert a number to a string.*
